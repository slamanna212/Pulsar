## What is Apogee
I wanted a desktop radio player for the Satellite Radio channels that get included with IPTV services/found around the web.

Apogee combines these streams with internet data to provide a beautiful player experience.

 - Recommendations - What you listen to and for how long drives recomendations for other channels
 - Favorite channels - See whats playing on all your favorite channels at a glace
 - Track your favorite artists/tracks and get alerts when they are playing
 - Light and Dark modes - Detected automatically or manually set
 - Live visualizer that reacts to the playing music - Cause it looks cool
 - Now Playing support - Integrates with your computer's now playing systems to show track info in the OS
 - Live Sports scores - Take the place of track title on sports channels when a game is on
 - Sirius XM metadata - Artist/Track/Album and more

## macOS startup diagnostics

If Apogee closes before its in-app log exporter can be opened, collect these files before relaunching:

- Apogee logs: `~/Library/Logs/com.slamanna.apogee/`
- macOS crash reports: `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/` (files beginning with `Apogee`)

The application log includes startup milestones for plugin setup, media-session setup, waveform capture, and entry into the event loop. Native macOS terminations may only appear in Diagnostic Reports.
